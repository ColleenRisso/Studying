## Objective: Build a form to add new students to our app

### Details
	- Front end should consist of a table view of all students
	- Clicking on a student should show a detailed view of that individual student's test scores
	- Front end should also include a form for adding new student


### Getting Started
1) fork and `git clone`

2) `npm install`

3) `npm run seed`

4) `git checkout cycle-1`


#### Tips
- Form components should be "smart" and have their own state
- Make sure form field values are "controlled" by the component's state
